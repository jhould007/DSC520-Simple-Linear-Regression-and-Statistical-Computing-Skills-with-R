# DSC520 Simple Linear Regression and Statistical Computing Skills with R
 An assignment for DSC520 at GCU that focused on implementation of simple linear regression and development of fundamental statistical skills in R.

 # Assignment Instructions
 
Special Note: Throughout this course, you will perform activities that will provide you with the background knowledge and practice necessary to successfully complete linear regression and multivariate analysis. Please utilize the resources found in Class Resources and the topic Resources to assist you with each exercise.

It is important to demonstrate statistical knowledge and practice R or Python programming concepts using datasets from external sources. For this activity, perform the following:

1. Research the concept of linear regression.
2. Explain the difference between simple and multivariate linear regression.
3. Formulate a question that can be answered with simple linear regression.
4. Select a dataset from "UCI Machine Learning Repository," located in the topic Resources. Note: Make sure to select a dataset where the Default Task is labeled 'Regression.' If you are not sure, consult with your instructor.
5. Identify the independent and dependent variables in the data.
6. For each variable inspect the dataset, decide: a) whether outliers are present and if yes, make and justify a recommendation on how to handle them; and b) whether the data needs to be cleaned up in some way; explain your rationale.
7. For each variable, explain, calculate, visualize, and interpret the measures of central tendency.
8. For each variable, explain, calculate, visualize, and interpret the measures of dispersion.
9. For each variable, explain, calculate, visualize, and interpret skewness and kurtosis.
10. For each variable, create a histogram depicting the frequency distribution and interpret the plot.
11. Perform simple linear regression in R or Python, using the appropriate variable(s) from the dataset you downloaded.
12. Display the results and include plots you think are necessary to support your findings.
13. Interpret the results.
Then, submit a professionally written and formatted software-based technical report. Make sure the documentation contains the code, relevant plots, your analysis, and the appropriate citations and references.

While APA style is not required for the body of this assignment, solid academic writing is expected, and documentation of sources should be presented using APA formatting guidelines, which can be found in the APA Style Guide, located in the Student Success Center.

This assignment uses a rubric. Review the rubric prior to beginning the assignment to become familiar with the expectations for successful completion.

You are not required to submit this assignment to LopesWrite.
